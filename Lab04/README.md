# Expansion Board Fabrication (Part II: PCB Layout)

## Lab work

1. Open the schematic capture of your project and double check that all the power nets of your design are named accordingly: VCC for +5 V and GND for 0 V. As an example, the power supply pins of the board should look like the figure below:

2. It is mandatory to configure the power rails before proceeding to laying out the signals. Go to _**Design â†’ Configure Power Rails...**_. On the _**Power Rails**_ tab, all the power supplies used in your project will be visible on the drop down menu under tag _**Name**_.
