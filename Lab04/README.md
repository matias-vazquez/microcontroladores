# Introduction to MPLAB X IDE

## Objectives

The main objective of this laboratory is to provide students with the foundations of the PIC18F45K50 microcontroller. This will be achieved through 11 documents that will guide the student to create their own Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and to program the &mu;C to allow the user to interact with it. Some advantages of the PIC microcontrollers over others commercially available, and the reason it is tought in this course, are listed below:
* Easy to operate
* Vast online  documentation
* Cost-efficient 
* High operating speed
* Free and reliable IDE

In this lab work in particular, the student will become familiar with the MPLAB integrated development environment tools. The student will create their first program using the MPLAB software and will put it into the PIC microcontroller (&mu;C for short), making use of the Curiosity development/evaluation board.

## Hardware and Software
The Curiosity HPC Development Board is an 8-bit prototyping board. It is designed from the ground-up to take full advantage of Microchip MPLAB X integrated development environment and supports Microchip 28- and 40-pin 8-bit PIC MCUs. Programming/debugging is accomplished through the PICkit On Board (PKOB) circuitry, eliminating the need for external programming/debugging tools.

MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an expandable, highly configurable software program that incorporates powerful tools to help you discover, configure, develop, debug and qualify embedded designs for most of Microchip microcontrollers and digital signal controllers. MPLAB X IDE works seamlessly with the MPLAB development ecosystem of software and tools, many of which are completely free.

## Laboratory Work
### Install the MPLAB IDE
1. Go to https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide, scroll down to Downloads section and download the latest version of MPLAB X IDE, then install it in your computer.

### Create, Compile and Debug your First Program
2. Connect the Curiosity board to your PC.
3. Start MPLAB X IDE. Go to *File -> New Project* and under *Categories*, select the *Microchip Embedded*; then, under *Projects* choose *Standalone Project*. Click *Next* to continue.

19. Before start, activate the windows that let us to see what is happening inside your microcontroller. On this window you can select what you want to verify; for example, general purpose file registers (GPRs), Special file registers (SFRs), etc.
20. Now debug the program by executing the code step-by-step. 

## Deliverables
 1. Upload your MPLAB project with the commented `main.c` to your GitHub repository and add the link to your technical report. 

 2. Turn in a short technical report to document your work. Include the following:
    - Link to your GitHub repository containing your MPLAB project, including source files.
    - Link to a video (2 minutes maximum), where you show and explain the functioning of your project on the Curiosity board. You can upload your video to your student drive or YouTube.
    - Image of the BUILD SUCCESSFUL window. 
    - Image of each modified register for the portInit() function when you debug the code step by step. __HINT: Put a breakpoint at the first line of the `portInit()` function and open the IO window (Window → Debugging → IO View).__
