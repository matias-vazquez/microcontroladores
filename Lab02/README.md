# PARALLEL PORTS (GPIO)
## Introduction
Whack-a-mole is an arcade game in which players use a mallet to hit toy moles, which appear at random locations, to send they back down into their hiding holes. In this laboratory, you will develop the microcontroller firmware that runs the basic operational logic behind this game. Moreover, you will carry out experimental firmware testing to correct possible logic errors of your design, using development hardware, including the Curiosity board and additional components. 

## Objectives
To become familiar with the basic instructions for configure and operate the microcontroller general purpose input/output (GPIO) ports 
##Activities

#### Software implementation
    * Create a new project in MPLAB X IDE for the Curiosity board (PIC18F45K50 uC).
    * Start your main C code with the LIBRARIEs / HEADERs section. Here, you will invoke all the required libraries and/or headers using the pre-processor directive #include.
    * Continue your C code with the DIRECTIVES section, where you will setup symbolic constants using the pre-processor directive #define, for example:
