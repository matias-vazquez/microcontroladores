# Introduction to MPLAB X IDE

## Objectives

The main objective of this laboratory is to provide students with the foundations to fully understand the operation of the PIC18F45K50 microcontroller. This will be achieved through 11 documents that will guide the student to create their own Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and to program the &mu;C to allow the user to interact with it. Some advantages of the PIC microcontrollers over others commercially available, and the reason it is tought in this course, are listed below:
* Easy to operate
* Vast online  documentation
* Cost-efficient 
* High operating speed
* Free and reliable IDE

In this lab work, the student will become familiar with the MPLAB integrated development environment tools. The student will create their first program using the MPLAB software and will put it into the PIC microcontroller (&mu;C for short), making use of the Curiosity development/evaluation board.
