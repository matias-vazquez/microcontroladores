# PCB Development (Part I: Schematics)

## Objectives
In this lab series of two, we will design the printed Circuit Board (PCBs) of a minimal system to use along with the Curiosity board to expand its hardware interface and make easier to interact with the PIC18F45K50 &mu;C.

## Pre-lab Work
1. You have the choice to Install Proteus 8.11 using Tec de Monterrey's student licence freely available, or use the remote Work Station you have previously assigned, which has Proteus 8.11 already installed.
2. Create an account

## Lab Work
Proteus is a Integrated Development Environment capable of capturing schematic diagrams, running SPICE (electrical) simulations, &mu;C firmware testing and PCB design. Use Proteus to develop the schematics of your minimum system, to, then, lay out the PCB and finally obtain the Gerber files, which are used by manufacturers to fabricate the physical boards for you.

Your minimal system will include input and output hardware components, such as LEDs, push buttons, a keypad, and so on, which will be connected to the I/O ports of the PIC18 &mu;C for you to interact with the &mu;C through wired connections. The comprehensive list of componets of your minimal system board is shown below:

| Component | Quantity |

| LEDs          | 8           |
| Push buttons  | 8	      |
| 4x4 keypad    | 1	      |
| LCD display   | 1	      |
| LM35		| 1	      |
| R 470		| 8	      |
| R 1K		| 8	      |
| R 4K7		| 8	      |
| POT 10K	| 2	      |
